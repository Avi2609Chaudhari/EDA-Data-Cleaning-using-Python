# EDA-Data-Cleaning-using-Python

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** process on a raw dataset. The goal was to clean and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. The analysis covers **data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier treatment, and performing both univariate and bivariate analysis**.  

## ⚙️ Techniques and Steps  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled messy and inconsistent data, removed duplicates.  
- **Missing Value Treatment**:  
  - Numeric data → replaced with **mean**  
  - Categorical data → replaced with **mode**  
- **Outlier Treatment**: Detected and treated outliers using statistical methods.  
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual variables, summary statistics, and visualization.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationship between independent and dependent variables, correlation plots.  
- **Imputation / Transformation**: Applied transformations for better data quality and consistency.  

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
