# EDA-Data-Cleaning-using-Python

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process on a raw dataset. The goal was to clean and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. The analysis covers data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier treatment, and performing both univariate and bivariate analysis.

⚙️ Techniques and Steps

Data Cleaning

Handled messy and inconsistent data

Removed/treated duplicate values

Missing Value Treatment

For numeric data → replaced missing values with mean

For categorical data → replaced missing values with mode

Outlier Treatment

Detected outliers using statistical methods

Treated/adjusted them appropriately

Univariate Analysis

Distribution of individual variables

Summary statistics and visualization

Bivariate Analysis

Relationship between independent and dependent variables

Correlation and comparison plots

Imputation / Transformation

Applied transformations for better data quality and consistency

Ensured dataset is ready for modeling

📊 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization

Scikit-learn – imputation & transformations
